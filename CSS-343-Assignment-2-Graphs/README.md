# Project Description
Assignment 2 - Graphs was an individual project created for CSS 343. The purpose of this Graph assignment was to use a graph to find relationships between 
different vertices.

For the Graphs project, I implemented a graph based solution to the Kevin Bacon Game. The object of the Kevin Bacon Game is to link a movie actor to Kevin Bacon 
via shared movie roles. The minimum number of links is an actorâ€™s Bacon number. For instance, Tom Hanks has a Bacon number of 1; he was in Apollo 13 with Kevin 
Bacon. Sally Field has a Bacon number of 2, because she was in Forrest Gump with Tom Hanks, who was in Apollo 13 with Kevin Bacon. Almost all well-known actors 
have a Bacon number of 1 or 2.

The task for this program was to parse a file representing a movie database, translate the entries into a graph, and then for each actor in the database, output 
the actors name, a tab character and the actor's Bacon number. If the actor has no Bacon number, than infinity is used to denote no connection to Kevin Bacon.

Bacon.txt is the original text file given to build the graph from, while the other text files were the test cases used to evaluate the correctness of the project.
