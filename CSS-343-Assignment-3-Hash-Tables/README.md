# Project Description
Assignment 3 - Hash Tables was an individual project created for CSS 343. The purpose of the Hash Tables assignment was to conduct an empirical investigation 
of hash functions.

For the Hash Tables project, I designed and implemented three seperate hash functions and analyzed each to determine the hash functions performance. 
I then wrote a report detailing the psuedocode for each hash function, created a histogram to visualize the chain length distribution, and then formulated 
an explanation for why the hash function's performed in the way that it did.


# Major Deliverables

-- C++ Source and Header files for the best performing hash function\
-- Analysis of the performance of each Hash function implemented
