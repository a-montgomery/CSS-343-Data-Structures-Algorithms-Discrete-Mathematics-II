# Project Description
Assignment 1 - Word Counting Using a Binary Search Tree was an individual project created for CSS 343. The purpose of the Hash Tables assignment was to utilize a Binary Search 
Tree to analyze a selection of text (.txt file) and count the number of times each word appears in the text.

For the Hash Tables project, I designed and implemented a Binary Search Tree to count unique words in a text file.

**Word count specifications:**

Word counts must ignore capitalization, so the, The, THE, and tHe all increase the count for the word "the" by one.\
A word is any consecutive string of letters and the apostrophe character, so don't counts as a single word, and best-selling counts as two words: best and selling.\ 
A blank space will not necessarily occur between two words.\
Numbers such as 27 and 2/3 will not be counted as words.\
